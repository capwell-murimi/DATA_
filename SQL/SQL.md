# Basics of SQL

## Exercise 1

This category deals with the basics of SQL. It covers `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses, `CASE` expressions, `UNION`s, and a few other odds and ends. If you're already educated in SQL, you will probably find these exercises fairly easy. If not, you should find them a good point to start learning for the more difficult categories ahead!

If you struggle with these questions, I strongly recommend *Learning SQL* by Alan Beaulieu, as a concise and well-written book on the subject. If you're interested in the fundamentals of database systems (as opposed to just how to use them), you should also investigate *An Introduction to Database Systems* by C.J. Date.

# Basics of SQL

## Exercise 1

This category deals with the basics of SQL. It covers `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses, `CASE` expressions, `UNION`s, and a few other odds and ends. If you're already educated in SQL, you will probably find these exercises fairly easy. If not, you should find them a good point to start learning for the more difficult categories ahead!

If you struggle with these questions, I strongly recommend *Learning SQL* by Alan Beaulieu, as a concise and well-written book on the subject. If you're interested in the fundamentals of database systems (as opposed to just how to use them), you should also investigate *An Introduction to Database Systems* by C.J. Date.

### Topics Covered

- Retrieve everything from a table
- Retrieve specific columns from a table
- Control which rows are retrieved
- Control which rows are retrieved - part 2
- Basic string searches
- Matching against multiple possible values
- Classify results into buckets
- Working with dates
- Removing duplicates, and ordering results
- Combining results from multiple queries
- Simple aggregation
- More aggregation


## Exercise 2: Joins and Subqueries

This category deals primarily with a foundational concept in relational database systems: **joining**. Joining allows you to combine related information from multiple tables to answer a question. This isn't just beneficial for ease of querying: a lack of join capability encourages denormalization of data, which increases the complexity of keeping your data internally consistent.

This topic covers **inner**, **outer**, and **self joins**, as well as spending a little time on **subqueries** (queries within queries). If you struggle with these questions, I strongly recommend *Learning SQL* by Alan Beaulieu, as a concise and well-written book on the subject.
